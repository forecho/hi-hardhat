# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
pnpm i
cp .env.example .env
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_artwork.ts --network mumbai
# npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <contract address> "Artwork Contract" "ART"
```
